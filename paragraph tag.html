     <p>We care for more ancient trees than probably any other landowner in the world â€“ this is one of our unique responsibilities in terms of global conservation.</p>
     <p>An ancient tree is one which is remarkably old for its species. The age varies from species to species, ranging from 150 years old for a birch to 800 or more for a yew.</p>
